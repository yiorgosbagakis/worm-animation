I set the project locally with RollerJS and then transferred the animation to github 

Here is the initial project on Vizhub: https://vizhub.com/yiorgosbagakis/3697d057d58a40dc8b48b0e388bf46e2?edit=files
Using D3 version 7 while watching Episode 5 of Get it Right in Black & White.


I Animated the circles in a more 3d space and changed the colours. I refactored the code adn split into modules.
