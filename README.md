## Using D3 version 7 while watching Episode 5 of Get it Right in Black & White.

This is an exercise from Curran Kelleher's course (Get it Right in Black & White Episode 6)

I set my project locally with RollerJS and then transferred the animation to github 

Here is my initial project on Vizhub: https://vizhub.com/yiorgosbagakis/3697d057d58a40dc8b48b0e388bf46e2?edit=files
